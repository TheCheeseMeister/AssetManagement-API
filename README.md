# Asset Management - Azure API

This a repo of the files used as a Function App for Microsoft Azure. Used to interact with SQL Server on Azure.

Azure Core Tools will be needed for runnng locally. I used Intellij for interacting with Azure since it has built-in functionality, but that also meant having a Azure account, so not sure how this would work on someone else's machine.
